The platform features two main views: a User View for customers and an Admin View (also known as Caf√© View) for caf√© management. Through BrewSpot, users can reserve a table online with ease, supported by real-time visualizations such as photos and interactive caf√© layouts. This allows customers to select their preferred seating area before arriving, enhancing comfort and convenience.
