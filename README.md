BrewSpot is an innovative caf√© reservation application designed to streamline the booking experience for both customers and caf√© owners. The platform features two main views: a User View for customers and an Admin View (also known as Caf√© View) for caf√© management. Through BrewSpot, users can reserve a table online with ease, supported by real-time visualizations such as photos and interactive caf√© layouts. This allows customers to select their preferred seating area before arriving, enhancing comfort and convenience. For caf√© owners, BrewSpot offers an efficient way to manage reservations and optimize seating arrangements through a digital dashboard.
